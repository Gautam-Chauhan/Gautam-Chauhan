In my spare time, I enjoy running, you can find my Power of 10 Profile here: [Power of 10](https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=802995). I also sometimes enjoy cycling, bouldering and playing the flute in a wind and brass band.

Thanks for reading! Please feel free to look through my respositories.
